    "A list and a tuple are both ordered arrays of values, but the difference is that a list is mutable, meaning that the individual elements within the array can be modified, while a tuple is immutable, meaning that once defined, cannot be modified. We hvae both of these organization & storage structures because a tu0ple is much faster than a list, and will essentially make your code quicker and safer (unmodifiable) if your values are meant to be unchanged throught its use."
